Using NLP Deep Learning Algorithms for systematic reviews. 

The aim of this project is to be able to reduce the workload of human reviewers drastically by having an algorithm that works for a small labelled sample set and still produce the best result. We also would like to create an algorithm that can be suited to multiple domains with the Inclusion Protocol serving as a seed.
